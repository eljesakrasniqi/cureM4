            <h1>Kingfa's Innovation on Reducing Plastic Pollution:
                Complete Bio-degradable Blown Film Modified Polyester Biodegr</h1>
            <p>Kingfa self invented Biodegradable Plastic plants have been successfully operated for several years. We
                are now one of the leading producers of fully biodegradable plastics with 44 national patents. Our fully
                biodegradable plastic film currently occupied 80% of China market. With the large-scale application and
                expected promotion of fully biodegradable plastic film produced by Xinjiang Production and Construction
                Corps, the "white pollution" problem of China agricultural production and other region's will finally be
                sloved!</p>
